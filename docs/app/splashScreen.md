# Splash screen  

![splashScreen](../img/splashScreen.png)  

this is the first screen you can see when you start up the app.

when you press the start button, the app tries to connect to the pi via [MQTT](mqtt.md) <!-- change when you know the title of mqtt md file --> and you get redirected to the [mainScreen](mainScreen.md) where you can control the robot.
